# Assembly To Machine Code Translation
A C++ program which can convert a RISC – V assembly code to its corresponding Machine Code along with Data Memory. Here is the link for RISC – V simulator https://venus.cs61c.org/ . All conversion is based on formats present in RISC – V Reference Sheet available in Project.

# Test Cases
Test Cases for several Programs such as Sorting, Factorial is provided in the project for better understanding.

# Support
The Project currently supports all instructions available in format.txt file. Pseudo instructions such as Load Address and Load Word (due to data part) is also handled.

# Built With/ Concepts Used
•	C ++      \
•	RISC – V (32-Bit Architecture)

# How to build program (In Compiler)
•	Type following  \
->	Place the code to translate in test.asm File  \
->	Compile A-to-M.cpp  \
->	Output will be produced in MCode.mc File  \
->	MCode.mc has Machine Code in Hexadecimal Form with Program Counter followed by Data Memory Part.
